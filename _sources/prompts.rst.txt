Prompts
=======

When you create your package, you are prompted to enter these values.

Templated values
----------------

The following appear in various parts of your generated project. Do not worry entering your username, full name and email address, these values are genuinely required in files
including ``AUTHORS.rst``, ``setup.py``, ``__init__.py`` and the package's documentation.

:full_name:     Your full name

:email:         Your email address

:github_username:   Your GitHub username

:project_name:  The name of your new python package project. This is used in documentation, so spaces and any characters are fine here

:project_slug:  The namespace of your Python package. This should be Python import-friendly. Typically, it is the `slugified` version of ``project_name``

:pypi_username: Your PyPI account username

:version:       The starting version number of the package
